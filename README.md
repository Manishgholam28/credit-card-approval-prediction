# credit_card_approval_predication
  A machine-learning model predicting the Credit card-eligibility of applicants based on customer detail provided while filling online application form &amp; Credit history of customer.
Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
A Company wants to automate the Credit Card eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form & Credit history of customer.
They have given a problem to identify the customers segments which are eligible for Credit Card approval, so that they can specifically target these customers

In this model, we merge the two differnt dataset. one is application_record.csv & another is credit_record.csv
